# Intro to Linux

This article explains what Linux is, what distributions are and how you should
choose one.

## Linux and distributions

Linux is an operating system kernel, this is, software that manages your
computer's hardware and resources, allowing you to run other software on it.

Other operating systems, like Windows or macOS, also have their kernels, but
they come bundled with software like a desktop, a file manager, and many other
programs. Meanwhile, the Linux kernel can be paired with any compatible
software you'd like.

**Linux distributions** (also called distros) are simply **bundles of
software** alongside the Linux kernel. Different distros have different
purposes: some are great for Linux beginners, others for servers, others for
tinkerers, *etc.*

## Our distro recommendation

You should just choose the distro that best fits your needs! Here at CeSIUM, we
usually **recommend starting out with** [**Ubuntu**](https://ubuntu.com/) (or
other Ubuntu-based distros), as they're great for beginners. We are also
familiar with them, in case you need our help.

<!-- TODO - link live image hardware testing and package management -->

We also recommend going with an **LTS release** (like 22.04), unless you have
some brand new hardware that might be unsupported by a slightly older Linux
kernel. You can read about testing hardware compatibility
[here](https://example.com).
This way, you won't have to frequently update
between Ubuntu versions and risk breaking things, but you also won't get the
most up-to-date-software. You can read more about release cycles in our
[package management article](https://example.com).

Nevertheless, feel free to try out other distros! Our next article is all about
it ;-)
